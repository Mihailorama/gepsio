This conformance suite is designed to test that a processor which extracts XBRL
from iXBRL is doing its job correctly.  To run it, users should:

1. Edit the value of IXBRL_EXTRACTOR in the file bin/CONFIG so that it
refers to the processor being tested.

2. If the processor is *not* written in XSLT, then further changes will
need to be made to bin/makeXBRL.sh so that the extraction mechanism
invokes the processor correctly.

3. If you are running on Windows, you will need to be able to run "bash"
and "make".  The easiest way to do this is to install a UNIX emulator such a
s Cygwin, which can be found at http://www.cygwin.com.

4. Run "make" to setup the tests and test the processor; or "make help" to
see options.

THIS SUITE WILL BE UPDATED FROM TIME TO TIME WITH ADDITIONAL TESTS.
